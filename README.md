# AVL_vs_SPLAY_Performance_Comparison
The purpose of this project was writing an algorithm that reads numbers from a file and create two trees. The first tree is a AVL tree, and the second tree is a SPLAY tree. After we have created the trees, we will print them in a pre-order form and tell the total amount of time units it takes for the tree to be in the final form. It takes 1 time unit for each comparison and 1 time unit for every single rotation. So, a double rotation will take two-time units.
- This project works from the cmd
- The input will be taken from an input file
- The output will be shown in the cmd

This project teaches us the following:
- Use the code from the cmd
- Usage of files
- Usage of pointers
- Trees
- Performance differences
- Function prototypes
- Nested loops
- Recursion
- Keeping track of your program
